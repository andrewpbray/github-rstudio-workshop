# Part I: Working Solo

Once you are in your breakout rooms introduce yourself to your groupmates and exchange GitHub usernames (go ahead and write these down somewhere). Then, working independently, each person will:

1. Go to your personal github page (for example, mine is www.github.com/andrewpbray).

2. Click the Repository tab along the top menu.

4. Fill in the name of your repository using `github-workshop-abray` (but with your own name), leave the other fields blank, then click the green Create Respository button.

5. Be sure the grey HTTP button is selected, then click the clipboard at the right to copy this URL to your clipboard.
