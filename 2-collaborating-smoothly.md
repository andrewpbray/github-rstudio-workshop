# Part II: Collaborating Smoothly

In your breakout rooms,

1.  Designate your teammates Player A, B, and C.

2.  On GitHub, player A adds B and C as collaborators on the repo
    (Settings \> Manage Access \> Invite a collaborator).

3.  Players B and C direct a browser to Player Aâ€™s repo and clone it
    into a new RStudio project.

4.  Player B adds name to author line, commits, then pushes.

5.  Player C pulls, then adds name to author line, commits, then pushes.
