# Part III: Collaborating Not So Smoothly

1.  Player A adds on a fourth name to the README, commits, then pulls.
2.  Player A resolves the merge conflict in the README, commits, then
    pushes.
3.  All three players add a new line beneath the authors called “date”,
    adds today’s date - each using a different format - and commits.
    Only Player A pushes.
4.  Player B pulls, resolves the merge conflict, commits and pushes.
5.  Player C pulls, resolves the merge conflict, commits, then pushes.
